# Sets

Like a List, a [Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28abstract_data_type%29) is a collection of elements. Sets have two key characteristics that make them stand apart from other Collection types like List.

 * **Sets are unordered**: Regardless of how data enters a Set, the ordering of its elements is _not_ guaranteed. This doesn't mean some order _can't_ exist underneath, but the data structure makes no promises regarding whether elements are ordered internally.
 * **Sets contain only unique elements**: There are no duplicates in a Set. If you add the string "hello" to a Set twice, there will only be one element ("hello") inside of it.
